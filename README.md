In my final year of university I was committed to a "final project", a
free style do-what-ever-you-want sort of software thing.

As a pseudo/wannabe-intellectual, I'd been reading various things around
Chaos theory, biology, evolution, artificial intelligence and game
theory. Along with good and bad sci-fi about future humans, generally
the upload-your-brain-into-a-computer-and-live-forever type of thing.

This project became my ambitious plan to create a colony of AIs that
would hopefully do, well, something, anything really.
The something became a game theory problem known as "The Prisoner's
 Dilemma" and the AI of choice became Evolutionary Algorithms.

It had already been done by other people, but I didn't know that then, I
blame Google for not existing and myself for not really doing any
research at all.

I did know a little bit about people researching Artificial Intelligence
and that they use LISP, so I thought I should do that. I went to the
Library and found a LISP book, then I went to the internet and found a
lot of different LISPs. I tried to find out which was the best, but they
were all the best, so that meant none of them were the best. So I used
Java instead.

While I'd learnt lots of interesting and useful things at university
like how to build a linked list, I didn't really know how to do anything
actually useful. Apart from an old application I made as bored college
student to take over the keyboards and open the cd drives on friends'
computers, I think this was my first application.

So, prepare yourself, here is a litany of things with the adjective bad.
